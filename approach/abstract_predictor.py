    """
    PredictionModel is an abstract base class for implementing machine learning models for regression tasks.

    This class provides a structure for defining methods related to model training, prediction, and updating.
    It includes attributes for storing training data, scalers, and error metrics, and requires subclasses to
    implement specific methods for model functionality.

    Attributes:
        workflow_name (str): Name of the workflow this model is associated with.
        task_name (str): Name of the task this model is associated with.
        err_metr (str): Error metric used for model evaluation (e.g., 'smoothed_mape').
        regressor (Optional[object]): The machine learning model used for predictions.
        train_X_scaler (Optional[object]): Scaler for normalizing training features.
        train_y_scaler (Optional[object]): Scaler for normalizing training labels.
        X_train_full (Optional[np.ndarray]): Historical training features.
        y_train_full (Optional[np.ndarray]): Historical training labels.
        model_error (Optional[float]): Error score of the model.
