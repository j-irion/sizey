### Run Sizey

1. Create a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies
2. Run `python3 main.py filename alpha softmax error_metric seed`

- `filename` describes the workflow from the data folder. For instance `./data/trace_methylseq.csv`  
- `alpha` sets the alpha you want to execute Sizey with. It has to be between 0.0 and 1.0  
- `softmax` toggles the softmax ensemble strategy. Set to `True` to use it, otherwise `False` for the argmax strategy.
- `error_metric` defines the XYZ used for ABC. Currently, it is either `smoothed_mape` or `neg_mean_squared_error` whereas `smoothed_mape` should be used and other error metrics might be experimental and change the impact on the RAQ score.  
- `seed` defines the seed for splitting up the initial data in training and test data and also defines the order of online task input.

Here is an example command: `./data/trace_methylseq.csv 0.0 True smoothed_mape 1996`

- Check the results in terminal, and in results folder.
